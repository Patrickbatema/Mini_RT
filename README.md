# Project Summary: miniRT (Our First RayTracer)

## Overview

The miniRT project introduced Ray Tracing for rendering Computer-Generated Images (CGIs). Such a practical project will force us to implement mathematical and physical formulas, thus simplifying the complexity that goes into computer graphics.

## Key Skills Acquired

### Programming Language
- Proficient in **C programming**, adhering to strict coding standards and best practices.

### Graphics Programming
Gained hands-on experience with **Ray Tracing**, and how it works in creating highly realistic images.
I was able to learn window management using `miniLibX` fluently with graphical windows, which includes handling window resizing and ensuring content adaptability of the entire window or

### Mathematics and Physics Application
These applications utilized sophisticated mathematical and physical formulas implemented in software for simulating realistic lighting and shadows, thereby giving more visual realism for computer-generated images.
- Mastered the basics of geometric shapes rendering, including planes, spheres, and cylinders.

### Software Development Best Practices
Memory management in C has been understood, implemented, and ensured without any memory leaks, so as to make effective and efficient resource utilization.
- Used **Makefile** in order to compile the source in this project, understanding the process of compilation, flags, and how important it is to have a clean code compilation practice.

### Problem-Solving
Improve problems-solving skills, develop and implement Ray Tracing algorithms, and investigate complex debugging issues of 3D rendering.

### Team Collaboration

Worked in a very productive team setting, learning how to integrate the different portions of the project seamlessly and support one another through tough aspects of the project.

## Advanced Features and Bonuses
- **Phong Reflection Model**: Added Specular Reflection, for the full Phong reflection model, giving it some way toward realistic images.
- **Texture and Light Management**: Introduced texture disruptions such as checkerboards and managed colored and multi-spot lights and bumped map textures to improve the visual quality of images.
- **Geometric Complexity**: This further advanced the already complex nature of our project: having more geometric objects in the scene, like cones, among others, to help the viewer understand how to render 3D objects better.

## Conclusion
It has given us great experience working with the miniRT projectâ€”much more than a strong foundation in graphics programming, mathematics, and team collaboration. And we would like very much to apply it in practice in the most useful for business and innovations for customers field of computer graphics at work.
